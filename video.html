          In this video, we explore the compelling narrative of 'To Kill a
          Mockingbird', a novel that delves deep into themes of racial
          injustice, moral growth, and the loss of innocence. Set in the 1930s
          Deep South, the story follows Scout Finch and her father, lawyer
          Atticus Finch, as they fight against racial prejudice and inequality
          in a deeply divided town." "Watch as we break down the major events,
          characters, and the social issues that make this book both timeless
          and relevant today.
